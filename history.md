History of HelluvaBossFansGroup.
start = 2021 october

HelluvaBossFansGroup was made in 2023 september, as a community to develop scripts. First account of HelluvaBossFansGroup was made in 2021.
When the first HelluvaBossFansGroup account born, it was a trolling community. First there was a simple GUI, that could run commands, like
"print()". Then we added draggable GUI to it (2022 december). Later, we added a title to it "Lua executor". This could execute Lua code, and not built-in commands. After that,
we changed the title (around 2023 february) to "ChatExecutor test". ChatExecutor test included:
- Title
- Draggable GUI
- Several colors

After that, around 2023 december, we released ChatExecutor V1 (ChatExecutor Serverside) trailer, but we felt like we should't continue the serverside so,
it's only a loadstring executor.
